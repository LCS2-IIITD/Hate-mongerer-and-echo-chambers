4392,"the good things of feminism the other day i experienced a positive , good consequence of feminism . a number of women offered not only my child their seat on the train , but me a seat so i could sit next to my child . one woman even insisted on giving me her seat to the point where she got up and walked away from it , so i sat down . this is a positive fruit of feminism , in the 1 9 7 0 s a woman would not have dreamed to have given me her seat . hashtag x 200 b hashtag so i should be thankful to feminism , right ? well , no , i should hate feminism s guts , and i do . this is because my sense is it is equally focused on two objectives giving benefit to women and harm to men . now that creating huge gender imbalance , and completely disempowering one gender , might harm women allcaps in the long run allcaps is not the point . i mean , allcaps in the long run allcaps it would be better for women not to sleep around before marriage , quit stopping her ex from seeing his daughter , and quit demanding a woman be filled in a job her son would otherwise be more qualified to have , and so ad infinitum . feminism s hatred of men seems to me to clearly trump both reason and the longterm good . it is , i believe , an incredibly powerful echo chamber . so politically potent . hashtag x 200 b hashtag now in slave era allcaps usa allcaps , was it rational that white people should enslave blacks ? was it in the long run good for relations between whites and blacks for whites to exercise enormous powers at the expense of blacks ? i would argue it wasn t . it was not only injust , but a recipe for discord and animosity that would express itself later in time . feminism is comparable to the enslavements of blacks in the allcaps usa allcaps , but it is lesser in degree . for example , blacks were regularly killed by whites . feminism allows wives carte blanche to kill their husbands and boyfriends , then when caught , claim battered woman s defence , with historical evidence of domestic discord , or even without , and walk free from prison . women who kill the men they sleep with in all australian states never serve prison terms for this very reason unless they are stupid enough to hire a hitman . the murder rate is low in australia , but there s a handful of such woman on man murders in every populous australian state yearly , and the result is the woman is convicted of manslaughter and always given a noncustodial sentence . hashtag x 200 b hashtag to our eyes , out of the historical context , the oppression of blacks by whites seems clear in its injustice . this clearly wasn t the opinion of the society it took place in for over a century . it was considered good and proper , clearly , as it was sanctioned by a society which considered itself good and proper . hashtag x 200 b hashtag so too is feminism considered good and proper in our society , and the endless barrage of defamation of men , the endless passing of laws to both help women give her the job the man is more qualified for , give her the kids , the house , the big cut of hubby s salary , the payout for sexual discrimination , the place at school , the place at university allcaps and allcaps to harm men to expose his name when charged by his ex for indecency , but suppress hers , the media using any example of any man acting wrongfully as evidence of rottenness at the core of maleness , a many times higher risk of going to prison and length of sentence when convicted for the exact same crime when compared to a woman . this is allcaps considered good by western society allcaps . hashtag x 200 b hashtag you men need to get that . if you stand up for justice for all including men , allcaps you allcaps allcaps re standing against what is good allcaps , allcaps you asshole violent man allcaps ! hashtag x 200 b hashtag so no , i will take my seat on the train , say thank you . repeated but i will not be fooled for a second about the most nefarious force that has entered western democracies since slavery , and that , to my mind , is clearly feminism . hashtag x 200 b hashtag what to do ? well the first thing i d say , allcaps know your enemy allcaps . i remember a chinese proverb , the beginning of wisdom is to call things by their proper name . so let us call , or at least understand in our own minds , feminism for what it truly is oppressive man hating ."

17757,"modern day slavery in america young men made to work for free for female privilege as you know , male college athletes generate well over money billion in revenue for the allcaps ncaa allcaps . virtually all of the profit in these sports comes from just two teams , allcaps mens allcaps football and mens basketball . despite these guys working full time and busting their asses to make these teams and stay on them , the money they make for the school is not even paid to them , but taken away and redistributed to female college athletics programs when not a single one of them generates a profit and in fact the two biggest financial losers are women s basketball and womens track and field . hashtag x 200 b hashtag in my opinion this is just another way that men s rights are thrown under the bus , as these players are clearly doing a job . they are on tv , just like the pros , the school is making money off them , the coaches and staff on these teams are not some volunteers but paid millions of dollars , while the players taking all the injuries and suffering , blood , sweat and tears are paid nothing so that females can get to play dead end sports with no meaning like woman s rowing . hashtag x 200 b hashtag while california took a step in the right direction it does not go far enough because it takes too long to come into effect , it should be immediate . further it does not recognize these student athletes for what they truly are , unpaid workers , doing work that would normally be compensated for . hashtag x 200 b hashtag moreover , the allcaps ncaa allcaps asserts that permitting pay would make athletes less integrated into their campus communities . if an athlete was being paid and it changed significantly their lifestyle , allcaps ncaa allcaps president mark emmert testified in a previous federal antitrust case , they probably would not be living in a residence hall . they probably would not be eating in the cafeteria , they probably would not be as as active a member or participant in the life of a campus . that is right , we need good happy slaves to stay on their plantation , can not have them living somewhere else getting dangerous ideas in their heads . hashtag x 200 b hashtag but unfortunately , the allcaps ncaa allcaps has been citing the vanskike case for years . a core part of the allcaps ncaa allcaps s argument is that the 1 3 th amendment allcaps allows for slavery allcaps for prisoners , and college athletes are more like prisoners than they are like free men and women . they keep coming back to the argument because it works for them . in the livers case , the allcaps ncaa allcaps isn t even relying on vanskike , it s relying on berger v . allcaps ncaa allcaps berger is a seventh circuit case that came out in yeah , , not that directly applied vanskike s reasoning to college athletes to decide that , like prisoners working in a prison , there was no employment relationship between the allcaps ncaa allcaps and its athletes . therefore , the schools didn t have to pay them a minimum wage in accordance with the fair labor standard act allcaps flsa allcaps . and then we get to the meat and potatoes , the schools view modern day men as allcaps slaves allcaps . which explains why they love to treat them like trash and kick them out for the slightest false accusation . college in america is increasingly becoming no place for young men to go . all of this is just about training men to work hard , expect nothing , so women can have fun at your expense . how many females in these athletic departments getting paid big bucks while men break bones on sports field and are legal slaves who go unpaid ? hashtag x 200 b hashtag"

8065,"no more heroes this is going to be a long rant of a post so i apologize in advance . does anyone else feel like they have been left without a role model from the men in their life ? for context i am a married year old male . i have more than uncles , a father , step father , both grandfathers , and a step grandfather . i played sports all throughout elementary and middle and high school . i volunteered on a farm for years in my adolescence . i had a lot of close friends girlfriends whose families i became very close with . i played guitar with a local jazz band that was made up primarily of older men . all of this is to say , i was around a lot of people who would be stereotypical candidates for good male role models . hashtag x 200 b hashtag i was recently asked who was your role model growing up ? who taught you how to embrace your identity ? the questions nearly broke me . i had absolutely no answer . with all do respect to most of the men in my life , they did not do a very good job teaching me what being a man was supposed to be like . some of them drank to much . some of them were racist and or homophobic . some of them were abusive to their spouses . some of them did not know how or when to be serious . some of them were just apathetic towards everything . some of them would get angry very easy . almost none of them took reasonably good care of themselves physically or mentally . hashtag x 200 b hashtag i look back at where i got my preconceived ideas about what good male role models are like and they are all based on media , instead of reality . they are all characters from books or tv shows . characters that i can not go to when i have questions or concerns or just need to talk . maybe that s enough but it seems like a low bar to ask for someone to be par at most of these things . hashtag x 200 b hashtag the night before i was going to ask my then gf s parents for their blessing to propose she wanted me to , no judgement please , i had no one to talk to about it . i wanted corey matthews boy meets world , to smile at me and tell me he was proud of me . the day an acquaintance of mine killed himself i had no clue how to console myself or my friends . i wanted jean valjean les mis to tell me life was full of pain and to let myself feel it because it made the good that much brighter . hashtag x 200 b hashtag the day i got accepted in graduate school i wanted atticus finch to kill a mockingbird to tell me i was ready for this , and i was not an impostor . the day i signed the loans that put me thousands and thousands in debt to pay for college i wanted arthur weasely harry potter , to tell me i was good enough and it was an investment in myself . hashtag x 200 b hashtag i am grateful to all of those writers and actors and directors who have made these characters such prime examples for what good men can be like . i am evermore aware of how important representation is in popular media as a result and i would hope every person of every identity can turn to some bit of pop culture for the bit of guidance they might be seeking . i would be lying if i said i wasn t a bit disappointed though . how is it that a group that s experienced such a wealth of content about people of their own identity , have not grown to reflect that . my grandfather loves to watch an old wartime tv show called m.a.s.h , but never once has he been as sympathetic to others as those characters often are . i dearly hope it has just been in my experience , but it is quietly disturbing to me the lack of heroes and male role models in my community . for a group that has seen an awful lot of privilege , they have not done a lot with those advantages character wise . hashtag x 200 b hashtag hashtag x 200 b hashtag to bring it back to those questions who was your role model growing up ? i did not have a role model growing up . i was just trying to be a good friend boyfriend son brother ect . hashtag x 200 b hashtag who taught you how to embrace your identity ? no one real . i have my own theories of how this ties into the rise of male rage resulting in school shootings and hate groups , but that s another post . the lack of answer is critical though . if you are a man without a role model , try to be one , even if just for a chapter ."

you got it , the women s rights movement . philippines divorce law is odd , as no other real country prohibits divorce , and i am not actually defending the law it seems outrageous to apply a catholic standard of divorce for example to atheists , muslims , or episcopalians my point is , who s agitating for divorce ? feminists . philippines is a valuable example because what we see is the progressive nature of feminism . hashtag x 200 b hashtag first it s divorce , fine , that s gender neutral . then it s no fault divorce , well , fine , still gender neutral , although it causes massive spike in the divorce rate . but now the zero sum part comes in courts award custody of children to mothers , hey not so gender neutral , more zero sum . then , we have suddenly got a significant percentage of the population being divorced women with kids hey the state needs to look after them . so there s welfare for single parents , again zero sum with women winning as they are the single parents . now divorce is a cost free option , because the state will carry the tab . then allcaps unmarried allcaps single mothers say , hey , what about me ! , so now anyone who has a baby gets looked after by the state . hashtag x 200 b hashtag i was once on a motorbike in thailand . and a sad looking , young looking , not pretty looking dutch woman came after me like a cheetah wanting to mate with a dachshund . all over me , wanting to come to my room . i must have friended her on facebook or something , but did not go with her suggestion she come and stay in my room . a few years later i look on facebook , sure enough a little white baby boy is born in holland , sans father . i do not blame this woman for having a baby , she was lonely and wanted one , and the dutch state took care of the tab . hashtag x 200 b hashtag so that s one zero sum game . but let us get now to couples , people who marry or are de factos . if you live in any western country here s how it goes you d better forgive her for her occasional adulterous indiscretions or you will get what s coming to you . if you have got kids , she will get them if you fight hard enough you will get to see them , sometimes . she will decide where they go to school , what they eat , wear , what out of school activities they do , what religion or no religion they follow , and how many boyfriends she brings back to meet them . if you have daughters , they will have the fortune of seeing and having modelled that women can have a healthy sexuality as the wife leaves her husband and brings back a series of male lovers over a period of years . hashtag x 200 b hashtag oh and of course , the money . elites are a little bit different . but for the majority of the population , she will get most of the assets even if it was paid for by the husband s earnings . she will also get a regular cut of your income after all husbands should pay for the care of children they are denied to see , that s perfectly fair , is not it ?

hashtag x 200 b hashtag so it s zero sum game across the board children , relationships , marriage , school , jobs . repeated but let us get to the really good one , crimes against women and children . so all this stuff i have mentioned above would still not keep down an entrepreneurial man who runs his own business . if he is his own boss , well , it s easy for him to hide income so his ex gets less which would tend to press her to the negotiating table re the kids and he will not pass himself over for promotion because he is a man in his own business , so his own talent is his only limit . now such a man might get uppity , and think he was equal with women , and go around doing a lot offensive male things like being assertive , picky about a women s sexual background and divorce history , and just being self confident and living without fear . hashtag x 200 b hashtag can this really be tolerated ? the feminists came up with the solution to that one too , let us change the law whenever a guy is charged with a crime against a woman ie . the ex girlfriend who cries rape . let us reveal his identity in the newspaper , but make hers protected upon penalty of contempt of court . let us make him testify in open court , but let us let her testify remotely via video . oh and if there s a hung jury , because some sexist jury member goes , oh wait , she was banging him the tuesday before , and sexting , but how come she s saying rape on the thursday ? , guess what she does not have to testify again , the court can just reply her recorded testimony . oh yeah , and we can not ask her about her sexual history , or say that the fact , you know , she had sex with her boyfriend for years might mean it wasn t rape . i am not making this stuff up it differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction , but there are a complete raft of these laws trying to engineer convictions . it often works , but not always . i spoke to a female former teacher of mine from university years ago , and she told me about a rape trial she was a jury member on . finally the jury did not convict because the victim about an hour after her rape went and had sex with her boyfriend the sexist jury did not believe that a woman who was raped by her friend not a cheating girlfriend , how dare you ! would go and then have sex with her boyfriend an hour later . hashtag x 200 b hashtag thank god i have never had to deal with false charges brought against me and let us face it , the system would grind to a halt if it started getting out of hand but just the fear of false claim again is used to oppress and strike fear into the hearts of men . i am not that worried by it , but mostly because i do not want to have flings with tarty looking girls with bad histories , and i think every man in his right mind would be aware of this and have some sort of risk management plan for it this , itself , is fear . hashtag x 200 b hashtag look , i have gone on and on , and i could go on and on even further . but i will not . i would celebrate women s day if it wasn t for the fact that it s really , help women , harm men day . it does not have to be like this , but it likely will continue to be so for the rest of our lives . in summation i have one point hashtag x 200 b hashtag feminists realise their objective is a allcaps zero sum game allcaps where there is a definite winner women and loser men . men and women who are not feminists need to realise the same thing , and the sooner the better ."
2372,"the importance of the . feminists often pretend they are about fighting an ideology , a system of men being in charge and so on , which both men and women internalize . this is how they derail criticism of their anti male behavior , rhetoric , and ideas by pretending it s about criticizing this dynamic . when i say pretending , i include pretending to themselves in some cases as counting as that . hashtag x 200 b hashtag now i want you to consider , if this was true , how would they talk about this ? when they talk about it , do they say , we need to dismantle patriarchy ? as in , patriarchy an ideology ? no . they say the patriarchy . that is not a superficial difference . it immediately changes what we are talking about and makes it an identifiable group of people which must necessarily be composed of men , and not women at all . it is no longer about fighting an idea , but some vague nebulous group of men . it is no longer about changing minds , but fighting enemies , and men who behave a certain way must be in cahoots with or working for this vague group . notice the comparative lack of hostility to women who act this way , sometimes dismissing them as merely puppets of this nebulous group and not the true threat . hashtag x 200 b hashtag what they are doing here is akin to someone who convinces themselves , and others , that they are merely anti zionist because of palestine , they swear . and then veers off into discussions on the jews and honestly does not see the problem in this . hashtag x 200 b hashtag it reveals a dissonance between the persons stated intentions and how they are visualizing the situation . it tells you a lot about how they think about the problem , and you can draw conclusions from that about how it will change their behavior . it means that feminists are ignoring that most of the time they visualize this problem , they are going around thinking of it in one way , and only when explicitly confronted on it do they parrot out a response that does not actually deal with the point we have made . hashtag x 200 b hashtag you are an anti semite . no , just anti zionist , i swear . hashtag x 200 b hashtag there s a way to be anti zionist without anti semitism . there s a way to oppose gender roles without feminism . this is never conceded by them ."
