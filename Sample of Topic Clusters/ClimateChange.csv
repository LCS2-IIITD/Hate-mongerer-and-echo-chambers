8328,"there is a runaway train racing toward us , and its name is climate change . repeated is not a scientific fact , it s the opposite recently a journalistic conference was convened in america jointly by the columbia journalism review and the the nation wink to survey the state of american journalism on climate change . criticisms of us coverage abounded but the criticisms also abounded with errors . in the keynote article the media are complacent while the world burns one finds this passage there is a runaway train racing toward us , and its name is climate change . that is not alarmism it is scientific fact . this statement is definitely allcaps not allcaps a statement of scientific fact which does not deal in metaphors like runaway trains . the statement qualifies as magical thinking at least , and probably alarmism too . conference participants presumably had some more substantive criticisms of us climate coverage . although i bet hardly any of them were more substantive than chris hayes observation from hayes who is an editor at large for the nation wink replied that his program had tried . which was true in , all in with chris hayes spent an entire week highlighting the impact of climate change in the us as part of a look at the issues that hillary clinton and donald trump were ignoring . the problem , hayes tweeted , was that every single time we ve covered climate change it s been a palpable ratings killer . so the incentives are not great . american journalism covers climate in three distinct ways validating the beliefs of the climate denier audience , with the most spectacular assertions one can find which possess a minimum amount of scientific support . validating the beliefs of the climate doomer audience , with the most spectacular assertions one can find which possess a minimum amount of scientific support . this is what s happening with the runaway train quote here . serving the audience which is actually interested in the science of climate . this audience does not have many beliefs which go beyond what can be shown by analytic methods . the real task of this strain of journalism is to expand the range of what can be shown by analytic methods . it s probably best to call this strain actual science journalism , rather than mainstream journalism . it s stupid to fault american journalism or any journalism for serving the first two audiences . that s the explicit task of much mainstream journalism to serve and form a relationship with the largest audience they can reach . many people are more interested in having their beliefs validated than in having them analyzed or challenged . these audiences will always exist . the real question is how large is that third audience ? is there a chance that it might grow to the size of the other two ? if it does , then mainstream journalism will have to yield some space to more actual science journalism . but the keynote article for the allcaps cjr allcaps nation conference gives me no hope that that emphasis particular set of journalism watchers intends to take a single step in that direction . they are in the validating beliefs mode , not the analytical mode . plenty of analytical mode writers publish all the time . there s no need to pay a single moment s attention to the largest mainstream outlets for instance , network television news operations . but you have to search for them . and complaining about the belief validating sections of the media does not actually make the search easier ."

17056,"deconstructing the percent consensus in their latest study from , cook et al . provided particularly good usable data , usable data that should have an effect on the figures . the authors have collected scientific contributions in journals , perhaps or as well . the authors obviously do not know that exactly . and because they do not know exactly , they disseminate different data in their supplementary materials than in their article . be that as it may , somehow abstracts of scientific texts were left , which the authors then had classified by these very citizens in a citizen science project , which unfortunately only found the support of citizens . the anonymous volunteers were given categories according to which to classify abstracts of scientific texts , in the hope that authors would describe in their abstracts what they actually describe to some and in the hope that the civic researchers would also understand what is described . this can be done by making sure that the citizens who come forward are not self selected convinced climate change disciples , that they see and read in man made climate change everywhere , and by ensuring that the criteria by which texts are classified are unambiguous and tested for reliability in at least two rounds . did cook et al . do this ? who knows ? they do not make any statement about it , which suggests the suspicion that they are not at all aware of the methodological problems mentioned . the fact that lonely figures , sorry citizens , anonymous citizens , are responsible for the classification of abstracts , while another citizens have produced just abstracts , also speaks for the fact that the results of cook et al . are not really what one would describe as the spearhead of methodical accuracy . the number of abstracts results from the double classification , each abstract was submitted to two voluntary evaluators . if you add the two numbers and divide by , you get abstracts , yet another number and yet another reason to doubt that the study by cook et al . even approximates the criteria of validity and reliability . it cannot therefore be ruled out that the volunteers , who make up the abstracts that form the current basis of the contribution , represent a group of climate change disciples who are anything but objective when it comes to classifying the contributions , nor can it be ruled out that the given categories will be used differently by the voluntary assessors . the fact that some authors who reviewed how their texts were classified have been annoyed by a misclassification of their work suggests that climate change disciples were involved in the evaluation . the very high number of conflicting classifications suggests that the voluntary evaluators applied the criteria given to them altogether and not uniformly . for example , in the question of whether an abstract contains an endorsement of man made climate change , there was a third of conflicting assessments . one should think that the question is easy to answer . and because everything is still not enough , cook et al . use a sleight of hand in their evaluation of the distorted results . the now papers published from to dealing with climate change are classified as follows on the basis of their abstracts contributions are classified as contributions that are considered by their authors as clear evidence of man made climate change . a subsequent review by craig idso identified of the contributions as misclassified . in contributions , the authors wrote about a human contribution to climate change , but did not quantify the contribution . in contributions there is an implicit confirmation for man made climate change , whereby the confirmation is sometimes so implicit that one wonders whether the authors falling into this category are not subjected to a series of violence . in articles there is no reference to man made climate change . in articles , the author expresses his doubts about man made climate change . in contributions the idea of a man made climate change is implicitly rejected , in explicitly . in order to calculate the percent approval , cook et al . completely exclude the contributions in which no reference to the influence of humans on climate change occurs . percent of the contributions are therefore irrelevant . the remaining contributions are grouped into two groups contributions are pro human climate change for the authors , contra . percent . in fact , percent of all abstracts evaluated are classified as per man made climate change and not percent . in addition , there is no need to sign the classification that cook et al . make . in fact , works , after correction , fall into the class of works that explicitly affirm and quantify a man made climate change , all other works do not fall into this class . the scientific consensus that is so important for climate alarmists has therefore shrunk to just percent and percent respectively . david henderson has made this argument . alex epstein makes a similar argument on his blog and also shows how the wrong figures cook et al . provide are immediately used by politicians to promote their agenda . source"
