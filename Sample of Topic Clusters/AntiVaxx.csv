9310,"merck has been accused of committing fraud in its gardasil vaccine safety trials putting millions of young girls at risk for ovarian failure or even death . hashtag x 200 b hashtag gardasil is said to protect against cervical cancer , a disease that in the u.s. , has a relatively low mortality rate of in per in the plaintiff s science day presentation on gardasil , robert f . kennedy , jr . reveals merck data showing gardasil increases the overall risk of death by percent , risk of autoimmune disease by percent and risk of a serious medical condition by percent postmarketing and adverse events reported during use of the vaccine post licensing are listed on the gardasil vaccine insert and include blood and lymphatic system disorders , pulmonary embolus , pancreatitis , autoimmune diseases , anaphylactic reactions , musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders , nervous system disorders and more merck s use of a neurotoxic aluminum adjuvant instead of a proper placebo in its safety trials effectively renders its safety testing null and void , as the true extent of harm cannot be accurately ascertained the allcaps hpv allcaps vaccine gardasil was granted european license in , followed by u.s. food and drug administration allcaps fda allcaps approval that same year in june . gardasil was controversial in the u.s. from the beginning , with vaccine safety activists questioning the quality of the clinical trials used to fast track the vaccine to licensure . lauded as a silver bullet against cervical cancer , there have been multiple continuing reports since it was licensed that gardasil vaccine has wrought havoc on the lives of young girls and young boys in the u.s. and in countries across the world . serious adverse reactions reported to the vaccine adverse event reporting system allcaps vaers allcaps in relation to gardasil include but are not limited to anaphylaxis guillain barre syndrome transverse myelitis inflammation of the spinal cord pancreatitis venous thromboembolic events blood clots autoimmune initiated motor neuron disease a neurodegenerative disease that causes rapidly progressive muscle weakness multiple sclerosis sudden death postmarketing experiences and adverse events reported during post approval use listed on the gardasil vaccine insert5 include blood and lymphatic system disorders such as autoimmune hemolytic

disorders nervous system disorders such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis , guillain barre syndrome , motor neuron disease , paralysis , seizures and transverse myelitis and deep venous thrombosis , a vascular disorder . according to manufactured crisis allcaps hpv allcaps , hype and horror , a film6 by the alliance for natural health , there have also been cases of year old girls developing ovarian dysfunction , meaning they are going into menopause , which in turn means they will not be able to have children . despite such serious effects , the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention allcaps cdc allcaps and allcaps fda allcaps allege the vast majority , or even all , of these tragic cases are unrelated to the vaccine , and that gardasil is safe . the plaintiff s science day presentation on gardasil video features robert f . kennedy jr . , chairman and chief legal counsel for children s health defense , an organization originally founded in as world mercury project and renamed in to focus on exposing and eliminating multiple harmful exposures contributing to the epidemic of chronic ill health among children . the video details the many safety problems associated with merck s allcaps hpv allcaps vaccine , gardasil . the information presented is based on publicly available government documents . kennedy notes that , if what he says about merck in this video presentation were untrue , they would be considered slanderous . however , kennedy says he is not concerned about being sued for slander . he says he knows merck will not sue , because in the u.s. , truth is an absolute defense against slander and merck knows that , were the company to sue for slander , kennedy would file discovery requests that would unearth even more documents detailing merck s fraudulent activities . kennedy s presentation does not go into the biological mechanisms by which gardasil causes harm . he directs parents and pediatricians to the children s health defense website8 to read peer reviewed medical literature sources for that information . instead , kennedy s presentation focuses on what he describes as merck s fraudulent clinical trials of gardasil vaccine , which were used to gain allcaps fda allcaps approval . while this article provides you with a summary of the key points , i urge you to watch kennedy s presentation in in its entirety , as this information may well save you or your child a lifetime of heartache and exorbitant medical expenses . how merck committed fraud in its gardasil safety testing kennedy says the fraud merck committed in its safety testing is a testing gardasil against a toxic placebo , and b hiding a percent incidence of autoimmune disease occurring within seven months of vaccination . in his presentation , kennedy shows table from the package insert9 for gardasil , which looks at vaccine injuries at the site of injection . it shows that gardasil was administered to girls another received the control , amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate allcaps ah elongated allcaps a neurotoxic aluminum vaccine adjuvant that has been associated with many serious vaccine injuries in the medical literature . a third group , consisting of individuals , received a proper placebo saline . in the gardasil and allcaps ah elongated allcaps control groups , the number of injuries were fairly close percent in the gardasil group and percent in the allcaps ah elongated allcaps control group . meanwhile , the rate of injury again , relating to injuries at the injection site only , was significantly lower at percent . next , he shows table from the vaccine insert , which is the summary of girls and women through years of age who reported an incident condition potentially indicative of a systemic autoimmune disorder after enrollment in clinical trials of gardasil , regardless of causality . these conditions include serious systemic reactions , chronic and debilitating disorders and autoimmune diseases . now all of a sudden , there are only two columns , not three as shown for the injection site injuries . the column left out is that of the saline placebo group . kennedy points out that merck cleverly hides the hazards of gardasil by combining the saline group with the aluminum control , thereby watering down the side effects reported in the controls . they hide the saline group as a way of fooling you , your pediatrician and the regulatory agency , kennedy says . looking at the effects reported in the two groups , percent of those receiving gardasil reported an effect of this nature , as did percent of those receiving the allcaps ah elongated allcaps aluminum control or saline placebo . the same exact ratio of harm is reported in both groups , which makes it appear as though gardasil is harmless . in reality , we know very little about gardasil vaccine safety from the data as presented , since the vast majority of the controls were given a toxic substance , and they do not tell us how many of those receiving a truly inert substance developed these systemic injuries . still , we can draw some educated guesses , seeing how the injection site injury ratios between gardasil and the aluminum group were similar . merck s use of allcaps ah elongated allcaps , a neurotoxic aluminum adjuvant instead of a biologically inactive placebo , effectively nullifies its prelicensure gardasil safety testing . as noted by peter gotzche with the cochrane center in , when he co filed an unofficial complaint against the european medical agency for bias in its assessment of the allcaps hpv allcaps vaccine , the use of active comparators probably increased the occurrence of harms in the comparator group , thereby masking harms caused by the allcaps hpv allcaps vaccine . risk evaluation when making an informed decision , you need to know both sides of the equation the risk you are trying to avoid , and the risk you are taking on . recall that , on average , in women will die from cervical cancer . if percent of girls develop an autoimmune disease from gardasil , then that translates into per . even if a in chance of dying from cancer is gone , does it makes sense to trade that for a in chance of getting an autoimmune disease ? and how many parents are comfortable giving a child a substance knowing there s a in chance that this substance will cause a lifelong disability ? yet that s the choice parents have been fooled into making . protocol merck has not disclosed how many clinical safety trials also called protocols it conducted for gardasil . a slide in kennedy s presentation shows a listing of several of the ones known , including protocol . kennedy says this clinical trial is critical because that was the one that allcaps fda allcaps used as its basis for giving merck a license to market the vaccine for use in children as young as years old . protocol is the only trial in which the target audience , through year old girls and boys , was tested prelicensure . the other trials looked at the vaccine s safety in through year olds . protocol included just children a very , very tiny group of people , kennedy says , for a product that is going to be marketed to millions of children around the world . aside from its small cohort size , protocol is also filled with fraud and flimflam , according to kennedy . merck presented protocol to the allcaps fda allcaps and allcaps hhs allcaps as the only safety trial that used a true nonbioactive inert placebo . this , however , was a misrepresentation . instead of pure saline , the placebo used in protocol contained a carrier solution composed of polysorbate sodium borate borax , which is banned for food products in the u.s. and europe , genetically modified yeast , l histidine and allcaps dna allcaps fragments . in essence , the placebo was all of the vaccine components with the exception of the aluminum adjuvant and the antigen viral portion . very little if any safety testing has been done on these ingredients , so their biological effects in the body are largely unknown . what we can say for sure is that these are not inert substances like saline . still , the children given the carrier solution control fared much better than any other cohort in the study , kennedy says . none of them had any serious adverse events in the first days . now , here s where merck committed fraud yet again . as kennedy points out , table in protocol shows that merck cut the amount of aluminum used in the gardasil vaccine by half . they tested a completely different formulation , he says . and , obviously , they took the amount of aluminum out to reduce the amount of injuries and mask the really bad safety profile of this vaccine since merck deceptively cut the amount of aluminum gardasil s most toxic component in half , the data from that study does not support the safety of the standard gardasil formulation . since protocol data are not based on the gardasil vaccine formulation , the trial constitutes scientific fraud . exclusion criteria another bag of tricks kennedy also describes another trick used by merck to skew results exclusion criteria . by selecting trial participants that do not reflect the general population , they mask potentially injurious effects on vulnerable subgroups . for example , individuals with severe allergies and prior genital infections were excluded , as were those who d had more than four sex partners , those with a history of immunological or nervous system disorders , chronic illnesses , seizure disorders , other medical conditions , reactions to vaccine ingredients such as aluminum , yeast and benzonase , and anyone with a history of drug or alcohol abuse . yet merck recommends gardasil for all of these unstudied groups . merck s investigators also had unlimited discretion to exclude anyone with any condition which in the opinion of the investigator might interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives . merck also used sloppy protocols to suppress reports of vaccine injury , kennedy says . for example , only percent of participants were given daily report cards to fill out , and they were only to be filled out for days post vaccination . what s more , these report cards only collected information about vaccination site effects , such as redness , itching and bruising . also ignored were autoimmune problems , seizures and menstrual cycle disruptions experienced by many of the girls . they also did not follow up with those who reported serious side effects . merck also granted broad discretionary powers to its paid investigators to determine what they thought constituted a reportable adverse event and to dismiss potential vaccine reactions . the researchers did not systematically collect adverse event data , which is the whole point of doing a safety study in the first place , and by not paying for the additional time required by investigators to fill out time consuming adverse event reports , merck effectively incentivized the dismissal of side effects . many of the illnesses and injuries reported were also classified as new medical conditions rather than adverse events , and no rigorous investigation of these new conditions were performed . according to kennedy , at the time of the vaccine s approval , percent of the gardasil group and percent of the controls who received either the aluminum adjuvant or the vaccine carrier solution had new medical history after the seventh month table , which included protocols , , and , many of which were serious , chronic diseases . risk evaluation , take taking all of this into account , here s how the risk benefit equation looks now the in chance of dying from cervical cancer may have been removed assuming the vaccine actually works , but by taking the vaccine there is now a in chance of getting an autoimmune disease , and a in chance of developing some form of serious medical condition . more lies according to kennedy , merck also submitted fraudulent information to its worldwide adverse experience system and the federal vaccine adverse effects reporting system allcaps vaers allcaps about the death of christina tarsell , one of its study participants . merck claimed that chris gynecologist had told the company that her death was due to viral infection . chris gynecologist denies that she ever gave this information to merck . to this day , merck has refused to change its false entry on its own reporting system , kennedy says . furthermore , merck lied to the girls participating in these studies , telling them that the placebo was saline and contained no other ingredients . and no . , that the study in which they were participating was not a safety study . they were told that there had already been safety studies and that the vaccine had been proven safe they made it so that the girls were less likely to report injuries associated with the vaccine , because they believed the vaccine they were receiving had already been proven safe and that any injuries did experience , maybe a month , two months or three months after the vaccine must just be coincidental and had nothing to do with the vaccine . but it gets worse , because there s a possibility gardasil could cause cancer . the gardasil insert13 admits it has never been evaluated for carcinogenicity or genotoxicity , yet its ingredients include potential carcinogens and mutagens , including aluminum and human allcaps dna allcaps , kennedy says . he goes on to show the results of merck s study protocol table applicant s analysis of efficacy against vaccine relevant allcaps hpv allcaps types allcaps cin allcaps or worse among subjects who were allcaps pcr allcaps positive and seropositive for relevant allcaps hpv allcaps types at day . what this protocol showed is that women who had previous exposure to the allcaps hpv allcaps strains used in the vaccine had a percent increased risk of developing cin2 and cin3 lesions after vaccination . taking the dubious efficacy of gardasil into account , and the fact that it may only impact one third of cervical cancer cases , the risk benefit lineup when taking the vaccine now looks like this hashtag x 200 b hashtag there is still a chance of dying from cervical cancer unrelated to allcaps hpv allcaps there is a in chance of getting an autoimmune disease there is a in chance of developing a serious medical condition if someone has ever been exposed to any of the nine allcaps hpv allcaps strains included in the vaccine prior to getting gardasil the risk of developing cin2 and cin3 cervical lesions is raised by percent , which may raise the risk of cervical cancer widespread gardasil use may trigger more virulent allcaps hpv allcaps infections to make things even worse , there are recent scientific studies that suggest a phenomenon known as type replacement , kennedy says . type replacement refers to when the elimination or suppression of one viral strain allows a more virulent strain to colonize . the study , shift in prevalence of allcaps hpv allcaps types in cervical cytology specimens in the era of allcaps hpv allcaps vaccination , published in the journal oncology letters in which analyzed the association between the prevalence of types of allcaps hpv allcaps virus in women who had abnormal cervical cytopathology reported that hpv16 , which is recognized as the main hr allcaps hpv allcaps type responsible for the development of cervical cancer , was observed in percent of allcaps hpv allcaps participants , followed by hpv42 percent , hpv31 percent , hpv51 percent , hpv56 percent , hpv53 percent and hpv66 percent . the prevalence of hr allcaps hpv allcaps types , which may be suppressed directly in the case of hpv16 and , or possibly via cross protection in the case of hpv31 following vaccination , was considerably lower in participants years of age hpv16 , percent hpv18 , percent hpv31 , percent , compared with participants years of age hpv16 , percent hpv18 , percent hpv31 , percent , who were less likely to be vaccinated . consequently , the present study hypothesizes that there may be a continuous shift in the prevalence of allcaps hpv allcaps types as a result of vaccination . furthermore , the percentage of non vaccine hr allcaps hpv allcaps types was higher than expected , considering that eight allcaps hpv allcaps types formerly classified as low risk or probably high risk are in fact hr allcaps hpv allcaps types . therefore , it may be important to monitor non vaccine allcaps hpv allcaps types in future studies , and an investigation concerning several hr allcaps hpv allcaps types as risk factors for the development of cervical cancer is required . sources emphasis the pharma letter allcaps fda allcaps . gov , gardasil vaccine allcaps nvic allcaps . merck s gardasil vaccine not proven safe for little girls . . levinsimes .

1857,"merck is dodgy as heck . repeated their gardasil was a measly percent effective at preventing cervical pre cancer allcaps cin allcaps , which was percent allcaps less allcaps effective than allcaps gsk allcaps s cervarix vaccine . repeated yet somehow still got approved for the us vaccine schedule over cervarix i keep hearing about so many women who are getting cervical cancer or high grade cervical lesions despite having been vaccinated with gardasil when they were younger . looking at the data , it s not really surprising . the three dose efficacy emphasis preventing emphasis allcaps cin allcaps or worse by any allcaps hpv allcaps type is percent for cervarix and percent for gardasil emphasis , with no data for gardasil9 . from review article important to note that this is the data for women who were all naive negative to allcaps hpv allcaps , and most also negative for any allcaps hpv allcaps type , before the vaccine was administered that means gardasil is less than half as effective as it s meant to be in the ideal candidate who was negative for allcaps hpv allcaps before receiving the vaccine . i mean , merck were promising that gardasil would prevent percent of cervical cancer or something . it could even be criminal when you consider that merck allcaps knew allcaps this from the initial trials , yet still promised women that they d be protected from cervical lesions and cancer . e . g . in the allcaps future ii allcaps trial , gardasil showed a pathetic percent efficacy in women this is all women , regardless of allcaps hpv allcaps status , so more representative of the general population who received the vaccine . was percent efficacy really worth the risks of the vaccine ? if i am going to get a new vaccine which was never tested against a true placebo , and contains an adjuvant allcaps aahs allcaps which was never tested vs . saline placebo in humans , i want a hell of a lot more than percent efficacy ! repeated hashtag x 200 b hashtag whilst cervarix , which was only designed to protect against the two strains and , actually has a lot of crossover protection for other strains , and ultimately provides almost percent protection from allcaps cin allcaps . hashtag x 200 b hashtag based on this data , no countries should be using gardasil anymore , yet some still e . g . the uk . sure , gardasil protects against genital warts , but i d rather have genital warts which i believe usually clears up within a few months with no long term effects than cancer or colposcopies leeps . hashtag x 200 b hashtag it s mind boggling how merck got away with this deceit . repeated despite all this , i am still on the fence about getting gardasil . the efficacy for gardasil looks a lot better than gardasil , but possibly not as good as cervarix . cervarix also shows more efficacy with a single dose . i am also not sure about the risks of cervarix vs . gardasil . cervarix has been out a lot longer , so it feels more of a safe bet , but it s almost impossible to find here in the uk so i d have to fly to another country to get it . hashtag x 200 b hashtag anyone know of any data on the efficacy of gardasil in preventing allcaps cin allcaps ? hashtag x 200 b hashtag edit just noticed the title of this thread is a bit misleading . i meant to state that gardasil is percent less effective than cervarix in subjects who were allcaps hpv allcaps naive at baseline , since cervarix percent effective and gardasil percent effective in such population . repeated although i am comparing percentages so it s not the most accurate maths happy . i think cervarix is almost as useless as gardasil in the general population i . e . a mix of people who are allcaps hpv allcaps positive and negative , but probably less useless since it provides cross protection for other allcaps hpv allcaps strains ."

1495,"convince me to get the allcaps hpv allcaps vaccine gardasil . repeated or not to get it since this is the conspiracy subreddit the pro vax vs . anti vax thing is so tiresome . for the past few months , i have been down the rabbit hole of researching vaccine safety , as i have been trying to decide whether or not to get the allcaps hpv allcaps vaccine . i have read dozens of research papers having a biochemistry degree and lifetime uni alumni access to several research papers has helped , mommy blog posts which i now mostly disregard , blogs and articles by doctors and scientists on both sides of the debate , and forum posts mostly on reddit which is full of a lot of pro vaxxers who have probably never opened up a research paper to see anecdotal accounts of vaccines . i am someone who likes the comfort of knowing all the facts before i do something . the vaccine debate is so painful because of the lack of evidence supporting vaccine safety . for example , i find it insane that the majority of vaccine clinical trials do not compare the vaccine with a saline placebo . so we have meta analyses which say allcaps hpv allcaps vaccines are not linked to autoimmune diseases except per million extra cases of allcaps gbs allcaps but percent of the allcaps rct allcaps studies did not use a true placebo they used aluminium or another vaccine as the placebo , or they are epidemiological studies which are pretty useless because the majority of the control population would have received some other vaccine . it s absolutely crazy that despite most safety studies using aluminium adjuvants as placebo , no systematic review has been conducted to assess the effects of aluminium adjuvants across vaccines . i came across this proposed meta analysis , but considering the lack of studies comparing aluminium adjuvant with saline placebo , i am not really sure how it s possible to do a meta analysis . repeated also , cochrane already kicked out an esteemed scientist for daring to question the methodology of the allcaps hpv allcaps vaccine review , so seems unlikely this study will actually go ahead however , i can not keep putting my life on hold to research this , it s become almost an obsession ! i do not want to get the vaccine preventable illness allcaps hpv allcaps cervical dysplasia cervical cancer and i do not want to get vaccine side effects allcaps gbs allcaps chronic fatigue syndrome auto immune disorders general weakness and susceptibility to disease . i have not had any vaccines for over years and i am very healthy and rarely get sick , i d rather not change that ! but sometimes , it s easier just to take the blue pill and go along with society s norms . i think to myself , if i do not get this one vaccine , am i not going to get any others ? what if i want to travel somewhere that requires , for instance , the hepatitis a vaccine which i have not had since it s not given in the vaccine schedule in my country , will i not get that either or just not travel ? i guess modern life presents us with too many options . we can get potentially deadly vaccines which prevent potentially deadly diseases , even though most of those diseases can be prevented in other ways , but ways that would limit your freedom e . g . in knowing that you are not protected from specific illnesses such as typhoid and hep a , you d have to be more careful what you eat in foreign countries . repeated even though you could still get other food borne diseases and the vaccine might even harm your immune system in a way that makes it allcaps more allcaps likely you will get some other disease ! similarly , if i do not get the allcaps hpv allcaps vaccine , i will have to be a lot more careful about my sexual partners , i will have to be very wary about their sexual history and it will be a lot more problematic if i find out they have been intimate with a lot of other people and thus more likely to be carrying high risk allcaps hpv allcaps strains . i d love the freedom of not having those concerns , and not being so worried about getting abnormal pap smears or having to have bits lasered or cut out of my damn cervix . but is that trade off worth the risk of taking a vaccine which has not been researched sufficiently enough to understand the risk of adverse effects ? where i could end up with life long autoimmune issues , fatigue or lowered iq as many studies and anecdotal accounts suggest could happen ? i have to decide which is the best option and it s so damn difficult when there is such a gap in knowledge on the safety of vaccines . i am worried that if i get the vaccine , i might attribute general ailments to the vaccine e . g . brain fog ? must be the gardasil ! tired ? that damn gardasil ! i am prone to anxiety so i want to know exactly what i am getting into first . as i said and you have probably realised , i am a person who likes to plan things out and have all the knowledge at hand to make the correct decision . i wish the scientific community would give us the full knowledge and then let us decide . from what i have read , i do not understand why pharma companies keep using aluminium as an adjuvant just because a guy years ago injected it into a rat and figured out it stimulated a good immune response story goes he was trying to find a chemical to stimulate immune response and he started at the letter a . repeated . there are so many other chemicals which may be safer that could be used as adjuvants . given the well established neurotoxicity of aluminium , it s crazy that it s still blindly used . for instance , calcium phosphate may well be safer and has also shown good immune response . i am not pro or anti vax , i just want to make the right decision for my health . i am saying this without meaning to be patronising , but please only comment if you really have spent many hours and ideally have an educational background in biology chemistry medicine understanding the science behind vaccines and the allcaps hpv allcaps vaccines in particular . if you do not even know the difference between the bivalent , quadrivalent and nonavalent vaccines , please do not comment ! i simply want to understand the facts and maybe there are some facts that i am missing , or studies you can present to me that may help me make this big decision . my concern with the gardasil vaccine in particular is it has not been researched for efficacy and safety for very long compared with gardasil or cervarix . and i believe the only studies done on gardasil compared it directly with gardasil , or gave it to people who had already had gardasil . also please do not tell me to talk to my doctor . i am over the age bracket that gardasil is recommended in the uk and when i asked my doctor about it , she said there was no point in me getting the vaccine even though i test negative for allcaps hpv allcaps and only had sexual partner . she said it is more efficacious in young girls . she is correct that the allcaps hpv allcaps vaccines have been shown not to prevent cervical dysplasia in women over , but that s when you do not exclude those who were allcaps hpv allcaps positive at baseline . when you just look at women who were allcaps hpv allcaps naive at baseline , it is almost as effective as in young girls . that is me , an allcaps hpv allcaps naive year old , so really she should have recommended i get the vaccine . also , i am literally less than year over the recommended age , i do not think my immune system s going to have changed that much ! it s no surprise though that my doctor would give duff advice since doctors rarely read research papers . i could easily say to myself , well my doctor said i should not get it , so i will not get it ! but a doctor in the allcaps usa allcaps would most likely have recommended i do get it , due to the medical advice in the allcaps usa allcaps being much more pro vax and the recent change in allcaps cdc allcaps guidelines which now recommend it up to . i wrote this in a bit of a rush , so apologies if it s a bit all over the place . tl dr this is not really a tl dr type of post , if you are not going to read the whole thing , then do not bother replying . but to wrap it up convince me that the gardasil vaccine is safe allcaps and allcaps efficacious long term i do not want to take the risk and it only be effective for a few years . ideally i am looking for studies that compare gardasil with a true saline placebo in people who had no other vaccines at the same time or at least not for a few years prior . this is probably not possible , so at least show me a study where they have controlled that variable i . e . they are not comparing someone who got gardasil and had no vaccines for the past years with someone who did not get gardasil but had vaccines within the months prior . or show me a study that compares saline placebo with aluminium adjuvant , to demonstrate the safety of aluminium as an adjuvant . studies that look at risk of autoimmune disease and the effect of allcaps hpv allcaps vaccines in people with a family history of autoimmune disease are also appreciated . or convince me that the major studies on allcaps hpv allcaps vaccine safety and efficacy are perfectly fine and scientifically sound . my concern is using aluminium as a placebo , and not tracking long term health effects e . g . an autoimmune disease that pops up year later . or if you think i should get gardasil instead , let me know although it s hard to find here in the uk now . i have read that cervarix is the most effective long term in preventing the most deadly allcaps hpv allcaps strains , hpv16 and hpv18 , but sadly it s not available at all in the uk anymore kinda regret not getting it when i had the chance . hpv16 particularly scares me a lot because it s relatively common and progresses to cervical cancer pretty quickly ."
