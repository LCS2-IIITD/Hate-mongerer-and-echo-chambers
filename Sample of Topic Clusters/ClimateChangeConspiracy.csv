11070,"climate change is bullshit , the green agenda the common enemy of humanity is man . in searching for a new enemy to unite us , we came up with the idea that pollution , the threat of global warming , water shortages , famine and the like would fit the bill . all these dangers are caused by human intervention , and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome . the real enemy then , is humanity itself . club of rome the first global revolution the environmental movement has been described as the largest and most influential social phenomenon in modern history . from relative obscurity just a few decades ago it has spawned thousands of organisations and claims millions of committed activists . reading the newspaper today it is hard to imagine a time when global warming , resource depletion , environmental catastrophes and saving the planet were barely mentioned . they now rank among the top priorities on the social , political and economic global agenda . environmental awareness is considered to be the mark of any good honest decent citizen . multi national companies compete fiercely to promote their environmental credentials and out green each other . the threat of impending ecological disasters is uniting the world through a plethora of international treaties and conventions . but where did this phenomenon come from , how did it rise to such prominence , and more importantly , where is it going ? while researching for these articles , and during my academic studies , i have come across many references to the the club of rome cor , and reports produced by them . initially i assumed that they were just another high level environmental think tank and dismissed the conspiracy theories found on many websites claiming that the cor is a group of global elitists attempting to impose some kind of one world government . i am not a conspiratorial person by nature and was faced with a dilemma when i first read their reports . but it s all there in black and white . the cor claims that we are facing an imminent catastrophic ecological collapse and our only hope is to transform humanity into a global interdependent sustainable society , based on respect and reverence for the earth . in the end i came to the conclusion that there are two possibilities either the cor wrote all these reports and setup a vast network of supporting organisations just for fun or emphasis they actually believe what they have written and are working hard to fulfill their role as the self appointed saviours of gaia . based on my close observation of their actions , and watching the recommendations made by the cor many years ago now being adopted as official un and government policy well , i have become personally convinced that they are deadly serious . on this website i try to use quotes and excerpts as much as possible and let the reader reach their own conclusions . so , what exactly is the club of rome and who are its members ? founded in at david rockefeller s estate in bellagio , italy , the cor describes itself as a group of world citizens , sharing a common concern for the future of humanity . it consists of current and former heads of state , un beaureacrats , high level politicians and government officials , diplomats , scientists , economists , and business leaders from around the globe . the club of rome subsequently founded two sibling organizations , the club of budapest and the club of madrid the former is focused on social and cultural aspects of their agenda , while the latter concentrates on the political aspects . all three of these clubs share many common members and hold joint meetings and conferences as explained in other articles on this website it is abundantly clear that these are three heads of the same beast . the cor has also established a network of national associations . membership of the main club is limited to individuals at any one time . some members , like al gore and maurice strong , are affiliated through their respective national associations e . g . allcaps usacor allcaps allcaps cacor allcaps i would like to start this analysis of the club of rome by

is ! this isn t some quirky little group of green activists or obscure politicians . they are the most senior officials in the united nations , current and ex world leaders , and the founders of some

green belt movement and many more . the concept of environmental sustainability was first brought to widespread public attention in by the club of rome in their book entitled the limits to growth the official summary can be read here the report basically concluded that the growth of the human population , and an increase in prosperity , would cause an ecological collapse within the next hundred years if the present growth trends in world population , industrialization , pollution , food production , and resource depletion continue unchanged , the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years . the most probable result will be a rather sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity . it is possible to alter these growth trends and to establish a condition of ecological and economic stability that is sustainable far into the future . the state of global equilibrium could be designed so that the basic material needs of each person on earth are satisfied and each person has an equal opportunity to realize his individual human potential . the overwhelming growth in world population caused by the positive birth rate loop is a recent phenomenon , a result of mankind s very successful reduction of worldwide mortality . the controlling negative feedback loop has been weakened , allowing the positive loop to operate virtually without constraint . there are only two ways to restore the resulting imbalance . either the birth rate must be brought down to equal the new , lower death rate , or the death rate must rise again . the result of stopping population growth in and industrial capital growth in with no other changes is that population and capital reach constant values at a relatively high level of food , industrial output and services per person . eventually , however , resource shortages reduce industrial output and the temporarily stable state degenerates . man possesses , for a small moment in his history , the most powerful combination of knowledge , tools , and resources the world has ever known . he has all that is physically necessary to create a totally new form of human society one that would be built to last for generations . the two missing ingredients are a realistic , long term goal that can guide mankind to the equilibrium society and the human will to achieve that goal . without such a goal and a commitment to it , short term concerns will generate the exponential growth that drives the world system toward the limits of the earth and ultimate collapse . with that goal and that commitment , mankind would be ready now to begin a controlled , orderly transition from growth to global equilibrium . so as you can see the even back in the club considered modern industrial society to be completely unsustainable . they state that even if population was frozen at levels , and industrial activity at levels , then the earth s ecosystems would still ultimately collapse . the cor has not changed these views in the slightest , in fact , in the last three decades their warnings have become increasingly more urgent and alarmist . they call this imminent collapse the world problematique and their proposed solution the world resolutique the limits to growth is considered to be the most successful environmental publication ever produced and propelled the club of rome to its current position of an environmental thought leader and a major consultant to the united nations . it has been translated into more than forty languages and sold more than million copies . throughout the 1 9 7 0 s and 8 0 s the concept that humanity was irreparably damaging the earth gained popularity and facilitated the formation of mainstream and activist environmental groups . all meetings of the cor are held behind closed doors and no public records are kept . however the club does produce many discussion reports that can be found on its website . the united nations contracts the club of rome to prepare policy guidance documents which it uses in formulating its policies and programmes . a quick search for club of rome on the allcaps unesco allcaps publications site reveals such documents . there are many other documents there authored by cor members acting in other capacities . as many high ranking un officials are actually cor members , this is like a man asking himself for advice , and then agreeing with that advice . not very objective ! various un organisations also hold joint conferences with the cor . while checking the club of rome website this morning the first item in their current news section refers to a briefing delivered by the cor to g8 officials preparation for the upcoming g8 meeting . the second item is a summary report from the club of romes strategy planning retreat with senior allcaps unesco allcaps officials . the joint cor allcaps unesco allcaps communique states we are at the end of an era a turning point in history . we are approaching the threshold of runaway climate change . we underline the urgency of radical action to reduce emissions , by both immediate action and longer term measures to stress to political leaders the non linear nature of the processes at work which will generate sudden change and to assert that the overriding priority must be to avert the impending risk of catastrophic climate change . cor allcaps unesco allcaps communique twenty years after the limits to growth the cor published another major report that became an instant best seller . in the first global revolution the club of rome claimed that the time to act had run out . it was now or never . delay in beginning corrective measures will increase the damage to the world ecological system and ultimately reduce the human population that will eventually be supportable . they also stated that democratic governments are far too short sighted to deal with the problematique and new forms of governance are urgently required . in order not too violate any copyright protection i will not reproduce the text of the book on this site . however , it is permissible for me to quote a brief excerpt in the context of this wider discussion . the complete text third ed . can be read and searched online at google books . as you read the following quote from page , first ed . , please remember the names of the leaders listed above . this is not some quirky little cult . this is the stated agenda the leaders of the environmental movement this is the way we are setting the scene for mankind s encounter with the planet . the opposition between the two ideologies that have dominated the 2 0 th century has collapsed , forming their own vacuum and leaving nothing but crass materialism . it is a law of nature that any vacuum will be filled and therefore eliminated unless this is physically prevented . nature , as the saying goes , abhors a vacuum . and people , as children of nature , can only feel uncomfortable , even though they may not recognize that they are living in a vacuum . how then is the vacuum to be eliminated ? it would seem that humans need a common motivation , namely a common adversary , to organize and act together in the vacuum such a motivation must be found to bring the divided nations together to face an outside enemy , either a real one or else one invented for the purpose . new enemies therefore have to be identified . new strategies imagined , new weapons devised . the common enemy of humanity is man . in searching for a new enemy to unite us , we came up with the idea that pollution , the threat of global warming , water shortages , famine and the like would fit the bill . all these dangers are caused by human intervention , and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome . the real enemy then , is humanity itself . the old democracies have functioned reasonably well over the last years , but they appear now to be in a phase of complacent stagnation with little evidence of real leadership and innovation democracy is not a panacea . it cannot organize everything and it is unaware of its own limits . these facts must be faced squarely . sacrilegious though this may sound , democracy is no longer well suited for the tasks ahead . the complexity and the technical nature of many of today s problems do not always allow elected representatives to make competent decisions at the right time . so , long before global warming became a well known issue al gore and his club of rome colleagues stated that they would use the threat of global warming to unite humanity and set the scene for mankind s encounter with the planet . in the same way that shamans and sooth sayers in medieval times used their advance knowledge of when eclipses would occur to control and terrify their followers , they would use a natural phenomenon as their enemy to achieve their objectives . but then they state that although global warming would be presented as the initial enemy , the real enemy of humanity would be portrayed as man himself . i am already noticing how frequently the terms climate change and overpopulation are being uttered in the same breath . having discovered that all these influential environmental leaders were associated with the club of rome i set about reading all the reports , lectures and speeches on their website as well as the reports commissioned by the un . i was amazed to find that they lay out their entire agenda for anyone who has eyes to see . exactly the same themes , concepts and phrases are repeated continuously throughout their publications . they are full of references to imminent collapse , dying planet , our mother gaia , wrenching transformation , united global society , global consciousness , new forms of governance etc . they truly intend to bring about the world s first global revolution . the kosmos journal perhaps the best insight into their worldview . this journal was founded by the club of rome in partnership with with several of its sibling organizations . as described in my article , the green web the cor has established a network of supporting organizations , each focusing on a different aspect of their agenda . the kosmos journal contains many articles written by cor members . the basic premise of their worldview is modern industrial civilisation is fast outstripping the earth s natural regenerative and life supporting capacity . repeated at current rates of resource depletion and environmental degradation a near complete collapse of ecological integrity will occur within the next years . repeated gaia , our mother , who nutured humanity for countless millenia within her womb of evolution , is dying . repeated a small window of opportunity now exists to transform humanity into a sustainable global interdepedant society based on respect and reverence for earth . repeated a radical change from the current trajectory is required , a complete reordering of global society . repeated humans only truly unite when faced with a powerful external enemy . repeated at this time a new enemy must be found , one either real or invented for the purpose . repeated democracy has failed us , a new system of global governance , based on environmental imperatives , must be implemented quickly . repeated now that obama is firmly ensconced in the white house the club of rome and its affiliates are swinging into high gear . the cor recently unveiled a new year programme entitled a new path for world development the club of madrid has launched the road to copenhagen a joint programme with the un environment programme intended to facilitate a binding global climate change treaty in . perhaps most interesting is the state of global emergency by the club of budapest in . the declaration states that we only have four or five years to prevent a total collapse of the earth s ecosystems . to quote from the document if we continue on our present unsustainable path , by mid century the earth may become largely uninhabitable for human and most other forms of life . such a total systems collapse could occur much sooner , however , due to runaway global warming or other ecocatastrophes , and or by nuclear wars triggered by religious , ethnic or geopolitical conflicts or access to diminishing natural resources . the macro trends driving these global threats and challenges have been apparent for decades and are now building toward a threshold of irreversibility . the scientific modeling of complex systems shows that when systems reach a state of critical instability , they either break down to their components or break through to a higher order of integral functioning . at these points of no return maintaining the status quo , or returning to a previous mode of organization and functioning , are not a feasible option . the acceleration of critical trends and cross impacts among them indicates that the window of opportunity for pulling out of the present global crisis and breaking through to a more peaceful and sustainable world is likely to be no more than four to five years from the end of . this is close in time to the mayan prophecy for the end of the current world . the period around the end of is likely to be a turbulent one for this and other reasons . predictions coming from the physical sciences foresee disturbances in the geomagnetic , electromagnetic and related fields that embed the planet causing significant damage to telecommunications and impacting many aspects of human activity and health . for the esoteric traditions the end of will be the end of the known world , although the more optimistic intepretations speak of a new world taking the place of the old . this may seem very strange a group of prominent world leaders talking about ancient mayan prophecies , but as i describe in my article , gaia s gurus many leading global warming activists openly advocate earth reverence and other new age philosophies . gaia , global warming , and global governance are intricately entwined , if one truly believes in gaia , and that she is being fatally harmed by the current system , then a new system of global governance and control would appear to be the only answer . global warming provides the ideal enemy to bring about this objective . it is easy for these global elitists to talk about sacrifice , wrenching transformation , population reduction and eliminating the use of fossil fuels but the implications are truely horrendous . even if you think this is all nonsense i would ask you to at least read these quotes and excerpts and think about the implications of their agenda . everyday i am amazed at how quickly things are changing . it is coming hard and fast . it s almost like reading a book and then watching the television adaptation , except that this adaptation is not a movie it s on the evening news . as al gore said in the closing sentence of his statement after he won the nobel peace prize . repeated this is just the beginning ."
17056,"deconstructing the percent consensus in their latest study from , cook et al . provided particularly good usable data , usable data that should have an effect on the figures . the authors have collected scientific contributions in journals , perhaps or as well . the authors obviously do not know that exactly . and because they do not know exactly , they disseminate different data in their supplementary materials than in their article . be that as it may , somehow abstracts of scientific texts were left , which the authors then had classified by these very citizens in a citizen science project , which unfortunately only found the support of citizens . the anonymous volunteers were given categories according to which to classify abstracts of scientific texts , in the hope that authors would describe in their abstracts what they actually describe to some and in the hope that the civic researchers would also understand what is described . this can be done by making sure that the citizens who come forward are not self selected convinced climate change disciples , that they see and read in man made climate change everywhere , and by ensuring that the criteria by which texts are classified are unambiguous and tested for reliability in at least two rounds . did cook et al . do this ? who knows ? they do not make any statement about it , which suggests the suspicion that they are not at all aware of the methodological problems mentioned . the fact that lonely figures , sorry citizens , anonymous citizens , are responsible for the classification of abstracts , while another citizens have produced just abstracts , also speaks for the fact that the results of cook et al . are not really what one would describe as the spearhead of methodical accuracy . the number of abstracts results from the double classification , each abstract was submitted to two voluntary evaluators . if you add the two numbers and divide by , you get abstracts , yet another number and yet another reason to doubt that the study by cook et al . even approximates the criteria of validity and reliability . it cannot therefore be ruled out that the volunteers , who make up the abstracts that form the current basis of the contribution , represent a group of climate change disciples who are anything but objective when it comes to classifying the contributions , nor can it be ruled out that the given categories will be used differently by the voluntary assessors . the fact that some authors who reviewed how their texts were classified have been annoyed by a misclassification of their work suggests that climate change disciples were involved in the evaluation . the very high number of conflicting classifications suggests that the voluntary evaluators applied the criteria given to them altogether and not uniformly . for example , in the question of whether an abstract contains an endorsement of man made climate change , there was a third of conflicting assessments . one should think that the question is easy to answer . and because everything is still not enough , cook et al . use a sleight of hand in their evaluation of the distorted results . the now papers published from to dealing with climate change are classified as follows on the basis of their abstracts contributions are classified as contributions that are considered by their authors as clear evidence of man made climate change . a subsequent review by craig idso identified of the contributions as misclassified . in contributions , the authors wrote about a human contribution to climate change , but did not quantify the contribution . in contributions there is an implicit confirmation for man made climate change , whereby the confirmation is sometimes so implicit that one wonders whether the authors falling into this category are not subjected to a series of violence . in articles there is no reference to man made climate change . in articles , the author expresses his doubts about man made climate change . in contributions the idea of a man made climate change is implicitly rejected , in explicitly . in order to calculate the percent approval , cook et al . completely exclude the contributions in which no reference to the influence of humans on climate change occurs . percent of the contributions are therefore irrelevant . the remaining contributions are grouped into two groups contributions are pro human climate change for the authors , contra . percent . in fact , percent of all abstracts evaluated are classified as per man made climate change and not percent . in addition , there is no need to sign the classification that cook et al . make . in fact , works , after correction , fall into the class of works that explicitly affirm and quantify a man made climate change , all other works do not fall into this class . the scientific consensus that is so important for climate alarmists has therefore shrunk to just percent and percent respectively . david henderson has made this argument . alex epstein makes a similar argument on his blog and also shows how the wrong figures cook et al . provide are immediately used by politicians to promote their agenda . source"

8328,"there is a runaway train racing toward us , and its name is climate change . repeated is not a scientific fact , it s the opposite recently a journalistic conference was convened in america jointly by the columbia journalism review and the the nation wink to survey the state of american journalism on climate change . criticisms of us coverage abounded but the criticisms also abounded with errors . in the keynote article the media are complacent while the world burns one finds this passage there is a runaway train racing toward us , and its name is climate change . that is not alarmism it is scientific fact . this statement is definitely allcaps not allcaps a statement of scientific fact which does not deal in metaphors like runaway trains . the statement qualifies as magical thinking at least , and probably alarmism too . conference participants presumably had some more substantive criticisms of us climate coverage . although i bet hardly any of them were more substantive than chris hayes observation from hayes who is an editor at large for the nation wink replied that his program had tried . which was true in , all in with chris hayes spent an entire week highlighting the impact of climate change in the us as part of a look at the issues that hillary clinton and donald trump were ignoring . the problem , hayes tweeted , was that every single time we ve covered climate change it s been a palpable ratings killer . so the incentives are not great . american journalism covers climate in three distinct ways validating the beliefs of the climate denier audience , with the most spectacular assertions one can find which possess a minimum amount of scientific support . validating the beliefs of the climate doomer audience , with the most spectacular assertions one can find which possess a minimum amount of scientific support . this is what s happening with the runaway train quote here . serving the audience which is actually interested in the science of climate . this audience does not have many beliefs which go beyond what can be shown by analytic methods . the real task of this strain of journalism is to expand the range of what can be shown by analytic methods . it s probably best to call this strain actual science journalism , rather than mainstream journalism . it s stupid to fault american journalism or any journalism for serving the first two audiences . that s the explicit task of much mainstream journalism to serve and form a relationship with the largest audience they can reach . many people are more interested in having their beliefs validated than in having them analyzed or challenged . these audiences will always exist . the real question is how large is that third audience ? is there a chance that it might grow to the size of the other two ? if it does , then mainstream journalism will have to yield some space to more actual science journalism . but the keynote article for the allcaps cjr allcaps nation conference gives me no hope that that emphasis particular set of journalism watchers intends to take a single step in that direction . they are in the validating beliefs mode , not the analytical mode . plenty of analytical mode writers publish all the time . there s no need to pay a single moment s attention to the largest mainstream outlets for instance , network television news operations . but you have to search for them . and complaining about the belief validating sections of the media does not actually make the search easier ."

10484,"let us examine the aspects of a cult and see how it applies to climate change . absolute authoritarianism without meaningful accountability . the leading advocates of the climate change movement are politicians , entertainers , and even children . climate preachers such as al gore and leonardo dicaprio lack any formal scientific training whatsoever and live personal lives of unparalleled luxury while prescribing carbon austerity for the masses . yet no one is permitted to point out their scientific ignorance or call attention to their hypocritical lifestyles . child advocates such as greta thunberg and the crudely indoctrinated children of the sunrise movement are essentially sock puppets for their shameless activist handlers . refuse to bend the knee to these tiny fascists , as diane feinstein most recently did , and the mainstream left will relentlessly attack you as an accessory to mass murder . the authority of climate change leaders is entirely unmerited and absolute , yet no one is permitted to hold them accountable for their ignorance , inexperience , or brazen lies . thus , the climate change movement clearly meets the first warning sign for unsafe groups . . no tolerance for questions or critical inquiry . the conclusions of the climate change movement may not be challenged or questioned under any circumstances . those who dare scrutinize the conclusions , methodology , or prescriptions of climate scientists are categorically dismissed as a climate denier , an excommunicated untouchable whose opinion is no longer valid on any subject . questions and critical inquiry aren t merely dismissed or refuted . the unfortunate heretic immediately experiences a relentless ad hominem onslaught of scorn and hatred from the political and media left and is often subjected to accusations of outright murder . simply question the effectiveness of a carbon tax and you may find yourself tied to a stake . there is no tolerance for questioning the climate change movement , and thus it clearly meets the second warning sign for unsafe groups . . no meaningful financial disclosure regarding budget , expenses such as an independently audited financial statement . hardly anyone knows just how much money is spent on climate research every year . the cost is spread out among laughably useless study grants , wind and solar farm subsidies , carbon offset credits , green building code evaluation and enforcement , salaries for bureaucrats solely dedicated to climate concerns you get the idea , it s a lot of hazy money . the abhorrent practice of sue and settle was a flat out money laundering scheme that allowed sympathetic government officials to transfer millions of tax dollars to radical leftist environmental groups . the practice only ended when the trump administration used executive power to clamp down on it . the total amount of yearly financial expenditure on the climate change movement is vague , difficult to track , and often carried out in unethical manners . thus , the climate change movement exhibits the third warning sign for unsafe groups . . unreasonable fear about the outside world , such as impending catastrophe , evil conspiracies , and persecutions . this one is pretty obvious . the climate change movement always shouts out revised and updated apocalypse predictions , eerily reminiscent of the stereotypical bum on the sidewalk with that the end is near sign . the world will end in x years if we don t do x is the constant refrain . the years always pass , and the apocalypse never happens . interestingly , this is a characteristic of multiple religious cults such as the seekers of chicago , and the order of the solar temple . at the moment , we apparently have years to nationalize the entire economy and phase out fossil fuels before we all die a fiery death . there s also no shortage of conspiracy theories about who is the earth s greatest saboteurs . they have an enemies list . the repent or burn doomsday preaching is the most well known staple of the climate change movement , and quite clearly exemplifies the fourth warning sign for unsafe groups . . there is no legitimate reason to leave , former followers are always wrong in leaving , negative or even evil . climate alarmists who leave , step back from , or even lightly criticize the movement are immediately subjected to vicious smear campaigns . dutch professor richard tol experienced this phenomenon firsthand when he removed his name from an allcaps ipcc allcaps climate report and criticized the reports excessively apocalyptic predictions . the smear campaign was led by bob ward , director of policy at the london school of economics grantham research institute on climate change . this has all the characteristics of a smear campaign , tol said . it s all about taking away my credibility as an expert . the treatment of professor tol is not uncommon and clearly demonstrates that the climate change movement exhibits the fifth warning sign for unsafe groups . . former members often relate the same stories of abuse and reflect a similar pattern of grievances . professor tol is not an anomaly . dr . richard lindzen of allcaps mit allcaps , dr . nils axel mrner , and countless other former allcaps ipcc allcaps in crowd climate experts were subjected to smear campaigns from their colleagues and the news media for the crime of throwing cold water on the outlandish predictions of the climate change movement . this pattern is all too familiar to anyone who has studied what happens to individuals who leave the church of scientology and clearly meets the sixth warning sign for unsafe groups . . there are records , books , news articles , or television programs that document the abuses of the group leader . the abuses of the climate change movement are loud and proud . they vociferously attack their perceived enemies for public consumption and are cheered on by fellow travelers in the journalism class . most recently they brainwashed a bunch of kids and marched them into an octogenarian democrat senator s office to beg not to be murdered by a no vote on impossible legislation . have you seen those kids in diane feinstein s office ? you should , it s creepy , these tantrums and protests aren t only meant to rally supporters of the climate change movement . they are a form of intimidation , a tactic used to silence those who question the gospel . there is ample evidence that the climate change movement meets the seventh warning sign of an unsafe group . . followers feel they can never be good enough . the atonement process for climate warriors always demands more . it started with using a recycling bin and grocery bags . now , in , being a good follower means imposing veganism on the masses and issuing fatwahs against innocuous objects such as plastic straws and grocery bags . despite all the efforts of the faithful , climate minions maintain a constant state of dread and despair , knowing they can never truly do enough to stop the coming doom . clearly , the eighth warning sign for unsafe groups applies to the climate change movement . . the group leader is always right . when have the climate leaders been called wrong for their failed predictions ? regardless of the weather , they are always intrinsically correct . floods ? climate change . droughts ? climate change . no snow ? climate change . too much snow ? climate change . tornados ? climate change . hurricanes ? climate change . lack of hurricanes ? climate change . see how this works ? one of the best aspects of the movement is weather is climate until it isn t . the acolytes of climate change will point out the window in a heat wave and say , see ? we re right ! if a skeptic points out the window during a blizzard , the same acolytes will simply cry weather isn t climate ! it s a game they can never lose , one in which they are never wrong and always right . thus , the ninth warning sign for unsafe groups clearly applies . . the group leader is the exclusive means of knowing truth or receiving validation , no other process of discovery is really acceptable or credible . the path to discovery for the climate change movement is an intentionally vague discipline referred to as climate science . did you carry out a study on gender and glaciers ? climate science . did you think up the worst possible scenarios that have no actual chance of happening an actual portion of the latest national climate assessment ? climate science . read this graf . i ll translate we re going to wildly speculate about some shit that is ridiculously unlikely because it would be scary pic . twitter . com jtt7yqxrlt will any science that confirms the tenets of the climate change movement is deemed climate science , while actual scientific research that disputes their conclusions is derided as denialism . the tenth warning sign for unsafe groups is clearly met . the verdict it s a cult"
