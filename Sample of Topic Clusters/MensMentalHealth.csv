8641,"have i been enabling my friend ? my best friend has has reached this point where he is purposefully emotionally harassing a woman and i feel as though i have been enabling this behaviour . i had the opportunity to stop him , about months ago , he had asked me if he had changed and i had pointed out he had become very bitter and vien according to him that meant the advice he got from a book was sound . the book was called the rational male by rollo tomasi , and i had immediate alarm bells when he showed me a paragraph which used language that i knew was found in so called pick up artist forums that are mysgonistic such as allcaps afc allcaps or average frustrated chump . i had asked him not to read it or to throw away the information , but i did not push hard enough and i ended up promising to read it to prove what was problematic about it . i got the audio book but i simply could not get through it , i could not make the effort to get over how boring it was to listen to and how difficult it was to even try give it the benefit of the doubt . the woman and him had a falling out . the details are all directly from him but i do not know how much i can trust them anymore , but apparently she used him in order to find another guy , my friend describes himself as a pseudo boyfriend in that situation . in the following months i would read him complain and talk about how he was essitenally having a psychological battle against this person , i could not physically see what was going on as he lives in another country , and i thought it be best to give him the benefit of the doubt , then i had enough and decided to stop trying to give advice over the situation as nothing i said seemed to work , but i became silent when he clearly was being unfair and downright sexist at times . now he sent a sexist message within his work group chat and his planning to bring her down with him if he ends up being fired and i think i am at fault for how things turned out . edit emphasis holy cow thanks for the silver , i really wish i would have gotten it for a different post because i d rather this never happened with my best friend but thank you . edit reading the comments of this thread has helped boost my confidence and i realise as much as i d want a situation in which i could nicely convince him to stop or magically resolve the situation , i have to be firm with him for the sake of everyone s benefit ."
9931,"is your expression of emotions a bit of a tightrope walk ? i just had the experience with a new very nice female friend of mine . we hung out last night . but then i received a message from another female friend of mine . because i have sent her a difficult email talking about my troubled feelings . she was like oh , i have my own life issues and i can not help you with your problems . if you thinking of seeking professional help maybe that s exactly what you have to do . so that was that i guess . i wish she would have said sorry you are going through some emotional pain as a preface to this go to the shrink i can not help you bit . i kind of panicked in response to that . i thought i had alienated a person i had considered my friend . as me and my new female friend were taking a bus to leave the place we hung out at , i was trembling . i often have tremors in response to stress and anxiety . i was really shook up . i could not hide it . so i told my friend that i may have alienated that other friend of mine with this difficult talk about feelings . she was very nice and offered to stick around just to hear me talk . i kind of declined and said that i will attempt self care on my own . and the stress relief came from an unexpected source i had forgotten my bag into the bar where we were . so i ended up running back to retrieve it . but i got a really good message from her that if ever i have emotional issues , i can consider her as my safe space . so i guess i kind of took the middle ground between repressing the feelings and just complaining about them . in the past i have been guilty of using women for emotional labour or at least endlessly complaining about my issues , while being too much stuck in learned helplessness to improve matters . so it was a bit of a tightrope walk for me . i was honest , admitting that i have problems , but chose not to be too much of a burden to someone i have only known for a couple of weeks . what about you ? how s your emotional expression going ? are you able to break out from the emotional repression entirely or do you too end up attempting a balancing act just to come across as a man that is more in control than you really feel like ?"
7875,"hating my father according to a male feminist , i am in growing pains stage of becoming a feminist . i can say for certain these growing pains have worsened my anxiety and so on , but i have reached this point where i hate the concept of the father . i hate all the toxic things my father passed down to me , how i can not be honest about my feelings , how i still have irrational distrust of people who are homosexual , how it appears all my life my ambitions for being a good person where guided by poisonous thoughts and lead to many people being unfairly treated . i somehow no longer feel comfortable sharing my emotional stresses with one of my female friends because i can no longer tell if i am unfairly asking for unpaid emotional support , is she just willing to provide it because years of conditioning from her father told her that s what women are supposed to do ? i know the type of responses forgiveness and not repeating the same mistakes , and focusing my anger , using it for positive purposes . but i still hate my father because a part of me knows i will grow to do the same to another . i want to kill that metaphorical father and let history forget about them , why should i want otherwise ?"
12688,"mental health , the medical system , and the passing of one of my closest friends . allcaps rip allcaps obyn . you are loved and you will be missed . to begin , i realize this is not really a conventional conspiracy post that would normally be submitted here but this community has been a home to me for many , many years and i hope you all will not mind that i take the opportunity to express some of my thoughts . as someone with physical disabilities , i do not get out of the house very often outside of doctors appointments so my social network is mostly online . one of the people that i met through that social circle went by the name obyn and he quickly became my best friend . we spent the past few years talking every day online and part of the way we d pass the time was by syncing movies to play simultaneously on our screens , such that we could chat about them and provide a bit of distraction from our respective illnesses . yesterday , following a brief message , my friend passed away after taking his own life following a years long battle with treatment resistant depression . despite years of fighting tooth and nail for access to quality healthcare in his country one of the nordic countries , he was constantly brushed off with ineffective medication and a once per month check up . roughly six months back , things got to the point of desperation and his family was able to get him an inpatient hospital stay . as other options had been already exhausted , the last resort treatment option he was offered was a form of electroshock therapy to the brain . although he said the treatment was not really working , the hospital nonetheless released him after only a week of treatment and a further dose of medication . despite constant pleas to try more experimental techniques , he continued to be let down by the medical professionals who had been in charge of his case in a system that seemed more intent on providing him medication than actually listening to his cries for help . i do not really know why i am posting this here i guess sometimes we forget what an online friendship really means until it ends , and i am distraught at the loss of someone who deserved far better care than he was provided by the medical system in his country . i know that the sands of time will continue to flow , and i am going to do my damnedest to live up to values that obyn demonstrated every day of his life kindness , intelligence , humor , compassion , bravery , love and levity , but i can not help but feel the current system of mental health care worldwide is woefully under equipped to deal with human beings on an indvidual level . i do not really know what can be done about that problem although i have no doubt it is the result of entrenched conspiracies , engaged in the pursuit of profit , but just typing out these thoughts has provided solace to me and i am grateful to those of you who have taken the time to read about this story . obyn , i love you very much and i hope you have found the serenity that this life seemed intent to deny you at every turn . you gave me a reason to get up in the morning during some of my darkest hours , and i will always be grateful that you fought so hard , and for so long , in the face of insurmountable odds . your bravery will inspire me for the rest of my life , and i will do everything in my power to ensure your name is never said for the last time . your friends and family miss you very much , and we will always have you in our thoughts . you were loved by so many , my friend ."

3880,"living with a lot of hate from my family and friends as a bullied and unsuccessful male this is a bit of a rant post . honestly , i am not really sure what to do or where to get help . reddit is therepeutic in the sense i can speak my mind here so i just wanted to let some things out . mods can remove this if they think it is too personal or pointless . the reason why i post here is just because i wanted to share something about how in my life , i think i have experienced that guys can be victims yet in my case always told about how lucky or privileged they are . i guess the bullying started growing up . my mother had these epic concerns of me , each one as if it was the awakening of the antichrist within me . one was that i was gay im not even gay , wtf , another was that i liked video games , and another was when i was working out , she thought i was doing steroids . so i grew up with these panic attacks . she was always taking me to doctors demanding that there were things wrong with me . my father is was that type of person who just only cares for himself . he never wanted to have kids and my parents ended up splitting up . some things i grew up with and learned to tolerate , like when my dad killed my dog or when my mother would have a panic attack about me being gay . my father also beat me and allcaps cps allcaps was involved , but i never figured out what happened as my father has a lot of money and my mother finally said to me years later he paid some lawyers to make them drop the investigation . to this day i dont have very many real healthy relationships . my mother still sends me awful emails putting me down or blaming me for things . ive also lived with a lot of bullying from others , even including some friends who have turned on me . i think it s even kind of unusual in a sense because people are surprised by this . repeated most people i meet express disbelief how could these kinds of things happen to you , you are so nice and tall and handsome ? i personally think if you wear emotional vulnerability , weakness and depression , these things seem to be such things which attract others wanting to take advantage of you . or even friends who will get fed up and turn on you . and there s not really apparently anyone who will say this out loud . it s like if you are a dude , and that s how you are , you are either just shit , or you must deserve it . some people tell me something like you have everything going for you or i feel like you were born with all these advtanges and yet all i want is my mother one day to write me a nice email , or to have a friend who i can trust , or to be able to forget about some bad things . a couple years out of hs , i aced my way through community college and because im lucky to be really good at the sats , got several scholarships . i contacted my father with the good news , and all that did was get him to manipulate me into going to one of the best schools i got into with his support , and then he ignored me , leaving me with the cost of a really expensive semester there . i know it s a rant , but my point is i am sick of all this bullshit about people telling me about all my privilege in life when they know nothing about it . so maybe you could say i am just a grown sad , sappy sucker , and based on what i have just said here , maybe so , but who cares . these things are legitimately wrong . are guys not allowed to have bad things happen to them ? an even if this was the full extent of my tragic life , i d still ask , then what do people really want out of guys ? do they want guys who cant be emotional ? do they want guys who dont give a fuck about anyone but themselves ? do they want guys who would act irrationally ? because guys like me , who take it on the chin , and try to keep going get absolutely no credit for anything other than some bullshit about how privileged they are . men can be hurt , too ."
183,"my lovely evening hey all , i am fortunate enough to have a brother years my junior who is just as interested in the ideals that this sub espouses . this thread is as much an appreciation thread as it is an exemplary case of being a good friend brother to your fellow man person . tonight we both got some wine in us and talked about what s been on our minds and some really poignant things from our interactions stuck out to me as great examples of non toxic masculinity and brotherhood personhood . they are as follows i have been sleeping on a couch because there are not enough beds in our family home when the both of us are home . this morning after i woke up i crawled my sleep deprived ass up to his room and laid at the foot of the bed he s been using . he mumbled out , get the fuck up in here buddy and i took that time to scramble up to head level with him . sometimes the biggest thing you can do is hold that door for another . we cried together , a lot . we have both lost people in the past year and having someone to uninbibitedly talk about those emotions with who is also a manly man was healing in a way that i hesitate to describe as anything other than miraculous . he listened to me . i listened to him . sometimes , when you know all about how someone is feeling , you want to jump in with your own experience to solidify their feelings and give advice as to how to proceed . i implore you to put that impulse aside and do some active listening first . i definitely learned this lesson from him first as we talked about what was bothering us . biggest one . we had intentional and reassuring physical contact . every time we spoke to each other about what was up it was met with some sort of touch . for us it was as simple as a knee touch as the other explained what was up . as we wrapped up we kissed each other on the cheek hugs we are from the u . s so for you all from european and eastern cultures who are already familiar with cheek kissing , this was a very very big deal . between this and number , these are the first times that these things have ever been conducted in our family . i hope that this post provides some insight and help for those of you who do not have the fortune to have such understanding and truthfully blessed siblings . as i write this i have tears welling in my eyes at my fortune . my last post on this subreddit was all about my suicidal ideations and now all i can think about is my brother . if you are ever in need of a figure like this in your life , do not hesitate to pm me . i will do my best in the limited way i can to be there for you . you deserve in every way the support that i got tonight and i truly , truly want to be there for you . i love you ."

because ted does not want sex from you , that s why . just because ted is nice to you , does not mean ted is nice in general . i have a ted in my life . this is a man i would have taken a bullet for . we grew up always trying to be the gentlemen who always had respect and class down to a science . when accusations against him came out , i dismissed them for exactly the reasons i listed above he was always nice to me and seemed classy . also it s hard to see the bad in someone who treats you so well . it feels like you are betraying them and being ungrateful for everything they have done for you . here s some food for thought are they really your friend or just buttering you up since they know when the truth comes out , they will lose friends by the truckloads ? i came here to vent and to discuss my experiences with teds . as we talk , i am compiling a rather disturbing list of women who ted has wronged but never came forward since so many people , even women , would jump to ted s defense . i had confronted ted about this briefly many years ago , but i will be honest , i was rather timid in the conversation . ted played it off like it was a miscommunication . i talked to the girl herself , and there were a lot of dickpics and outright vulgar requests verbal depictions . i have never felt more betrayed in my life . after the accusations started piling up , i started to see ted for who he really was , but i can not let go of all the things he s done for me and i feel so fucking lost and broken . none of the women he has hurt , are aware of each other and do not care enough to make a big deal about it since it was all over the phone . i am so god damn angry and yet . repeated he s been one of the few people who s had my back and i have been abandoned so many times . i am waiting for that one big accusation , where some girl comes forward saying ted did something to her . i will be there . repeated with this compilation . i will look that man in the eyes while sealing his judicial fate and i will hate every fucking minute of it while doing it without hesitation . am i a man now , ted ? hashtag x 200 b hashtag edit there are so many assumptions and misinformation going on . i originally wasn t gonna bother but at this point , i might as well clarify . . no , ted and i are not friends . i make sure to occasionally keep in contact so when he brings up some side drama like another victim of his that he s trying to slander i will know who to talk to . i also do not have a lot of information i need . i do not know the names of any of his exs so i can check with them if he acted this way as well . the idea is to compile the information to give to . repeated whoever needs it . maybe a lawyer , maybe to whoever wants to prosecute him , but the issue is everyone is out of their statue of limitation all of this is like years old ish , i do not have an exact time frame . and do not have the texts anymore . part of me is also hoping that he can be redeemed , will own his actions , give a legitimate apology and change . i bounce back and forth between hating him and hoping i can help change him . this is how much the entire situation is screwing with my head . . when i posted this , i was drunk and depressed and my only thought process was to vent about how much it all hurt . intellectually i know i am doing the right thing , but that does not mean it does not suck . i have been friends with this guy for about a decade . he s given me rides to job interviews and even bought my e and i groceries when we needed it , twice , like filled our fridge . my dad was never a good rolemodel and i was more than happy to let ted fill that role . he s not just some friend , he was like a brother to me . it s not like he just fucked up , he crossed a line i can not step over or look away from . i am allowed to feel shitty about this without being accused of condoning sexual harassment . this little project keeps reminding me over and over how betrayed i feel . since this all came to light , i stopped making new friends . i just can not bring myself to get close to anyone else . this is insanely hard for me right now and i do not need a bunch of judgmental assholes expecting me to just shrug off a third of my life . if you do not understand how i feel then please be respectful and leave me the fuck alone . . none of the women i have talked to are traumatized from it . when they gave me the details , it was with angry eyerolls and disgust , even a few laughs at how pathetic he was being . in their words it s just not worth the drama to bring back up , honestly . i am debating on collecting all of it and confronting him about it and record the conversation . at the very least , i can expose him with video evidence of who he is . that feels so elongated youtube yes i am making that a phrase like something being so highschool but honestly this has to end . i think it s better for the women to come forward but so far , out of the five victims , no one wants to deal with it . . i am conflicted on how to proceed . do i respect the fact that these women want nothing to do with the situation and leave them alone about it ? is it guilt tripping to urge them to speak up ? do they secretly just need to be encouraged or is that wrong ? i do not know . so right now , i am just gathering a list of names and details when they want to tell me ."

sexual abuse and frank talk of depression and suicide towards the end . when i was , the coolest person in the world to me was my older male cousin . he was a teenager but still young enough to not act completely dismissive of me , and thus quickly became my role model . long story short because i am not entirely comfortable going into explicit detail at my grandmother s house , he wanted me to play a game that involved sucking his dick . at the time , i thought this was weird , but i was so i rolled with it . i guess i was lucky it wasn t violent , but i do not think you could say i had any good luck in this scenario . i am going to skip over the immediate aftermath and come back to it later , because until recently i did not know there was an aftermath . skipping ahead to puberty , i had gone through cycles of remembering the incident , then convincing myself it had to be a dream because it was so bizarre , but by the time i was i had come to the conclusion that it had happened , and this set a kind of anger i d never experienced to simmer in me . this led to a long phase of questions about my own purity virginity , which led to a cycle of self hatred and a feeling of profound and intimate bettrayal that i am still shaking off to this day . over the next few years i was lucky enough to be able to learn a new worldview based around defining myself for myself rather than what others expected of me this was where i started being aware of toxic masculinity as a concept getting back to my cousin , he had at the time been struggling with his sexuality and had a rough home life , which makes his actions make a kind of sense , but does not in any way excuse them . he had run away to the twin cities , but still had his yearly visits to my grandma s house for the holidays . by the time i was i had come to the warped conclusion that in order for me to have some sort of closure , i had to seek closure with him of some kind . not calling him out , but more like letting him know i remembered and that i understood what he had been going through again , warped conclusion here . but every year i tried i just froze . afterwords there would be a flood of self hate again , damning myself for not being able to have a simple conversation , for not being able to man up enough to say just a few words . this had the side effect of christmas and thanksgiving being massive anxiety and depression triggers for me to this day . skipping ahead to the last leg this story , my cousin contracted allcaps hiv allcaps while he was in the cities , and within a couple years had died due to complications with the resulting illness . i remember very vividly thinking i should be feeling something at the time but feeling nothing . i was shaking with rage at the funeral later when the rest of my family was crying . but mostly afterwards i felt that deep sense of betrayal again now that i would never have the chance to get that closure i thought i needed . here s where things get worse though . a few years back , when i was finally getting the mental health care i needed , i sat down with my immediate family and had a sort of coming out to explain why i had been going to the doctor so much and explain what i was dealing with there was a lot else happening at the time and when i mentioned being molested , my mother informed me that she knew , and that everyone in the family had known except the other kids . now i will cut back to the immediate fallout of the incident . i had talked about the event , because i was and four year olds talk about everything . in short order , my father had pinned my cousin and started beating him . he may have killed him if my mother had not pulled him off . when my cousin went home , the same thing happened with my uncle and aunt . i had gone my whole life holding what i thought was a terrible secret , when literally everyone i kept it from already knew . these same people had also chosen to continue inviting my cousin to all those family events . now i have never gotten direct confirmation of their motivations , but i strongly suspect that they justified keeping him around with some version of boys will be boys . i also strongly suspect that the reason no one talked to me about it or had any kind of therapy was also because of the male expectation that if we do not talk about it , it will not affect us . i want to say that the most insidious part of this whole fiasco is that everyone believes that they were doing what was best . my best argument for this impression is the fact that my mother has a framed photo of my abuser in her living room . i do not see a scenario in which she kept that picture while fully comprehending the damage that had been done . heavy stuff aside , i would like to share now what i have learned from my recovery process . talk about it . seriously , trauma or even something so small as a bad mood wont go away if you plug your ears and hide . the only way people will know when you are struggling is to tell them , and the only way other victims can learn from you is if you tell them about it . i went most of my whole life keeping it a secret and it literally almost killed me . this is the main reason i decided to make this post do not let your abuser become the center of your world . i spent years thinking i had to do something to for my cousin to find closure . it wasn t until that became impossible did i finally being to get closure . there was no vindication in my cousin dying horribly , only a vague hollowness followed by anger at those who mourned his passing . i only began my recovery once i became the focus of my efforts . toxic masculinity often comes from a place of empathy , and i do not really know how to deal with that . no one in my family knew that pretending it did not happen would permanently mess my childhood up . the idea of he s a boy man , he can handle it comes from a place of believing the other party is strong in ways that are often impossible . sexual abuse is not granular . i spent many years arguing with myself about whether i had been really raped if he did not cum , or if i had been willingly playing the game . these brain twisting thoughts are horrible to deal with and sidestep the main point . if your were taken advantage of , coerced , tricked , forced , beaten , into doing a sexual act it does not matter how long or to what degree . if your were abused , sexually , the you were sexually abused . you do not need to make excuses for yourself or your abuser , you can let yourself be angry . virginity sexual purity is a toxic concept that needs to die . smiliar to how many men stress about still being a virgin after some arbitrary and inconsistent point , i spent my puberty stressing about whether i was even still a virgin and that i had been tainted before i even could comprehend consenting to it . this whole thing is wrapped up in a warped value system that gamifies human intimacy . sexual abuse and sexuality are not intrinsically linked , but they do have some awful interactions . my trip through puberty into young adulthood came with the overdue conclusion that i am demisexual . if you do not know , it basically means that for me , sexual attraction follows emotional connection . so for a largely asexual orientation , i spent a lot of years thinking i was just sexually broken . again showing how sexual abuse warps your whole outlook . it was extra distressing when realizing i may have a sexual interest in men , when the internalized homophobia that i had convinced me that because of my abuser by a man , i would now be attracted to men that old catching the gay chesnut . get help . i cannot stress this enough , i did not improve until i was on proper medication and in therapy . even if you do not think you need it get help . there is no one keeping score of the things you can privately overcome , and the wonderful people in the mental health community are there to make life better and easier . bottling does not work . ignoring your feelings does not make them go away . i grew up with the same male expectations of stoicism , my family specifically shames and treats expression of emotional juvenile . you still react emotionally to everything , and pretending you do not only kneecaps your ability to understand yourself . going back to sexuality , me being demisexual makes my struggle in overcoming this particular issue extra salient . if i can not let myself get close to someone , there s no chance i would ever be attracted to them . this combined with some unhealthy expectations of needing to be in a relationship to make even more self hatred . finally i d like to put a section here for anyone who may be worried about me currently , and for those who may be where i was . despite all of that happening to me and more , i got the help i needed , and i feel like i have become a person again rather than a passenger in my own life . i am not fully recovered , i do not think i will ever hit done on my mental health journey , but just four years ago i spent significant time revising my suicide note so as to minimize any guilt my family might feel while trying to decide what method would be the least terrifying . today i am living on my own with my girlfriend in a committed relationship , i am on a good medication , i have a full time job with my own health insurance , and ar regular night a week to get together with friends . there is always a path to recovery , but it starts with asking for help . edit formatting

14915,"has anyone seen six feet under ? if so , how do you feel about the nate getting raped by a yo woman subplot and the fact that the show treats it like it s no big deal and that ruth is crazy for thinking otherwise ? i am only at s02e07 so no spoilers about anything other than this shit fucking subplot , but this show has consistently so far taken a clear moral stance against things it considers moral wrongs . for example , when rico implied that david is a lesser man or no man for being gay , david stood up to him and declared that he infact is a man and shut rico down . even though rico did not stop being homophobic after that which is natural since i do not know anyone who changed their fundamental beliefs immediately after being shouted down , the show still made a statement , that rico is wrong for holding those views . i wish they did something similar with nate getting raped . they kind of did it , when ruth s sister sincerely apologized for letting that happen , but then the very next episode , claire did the classic dudes are always horny as fuck so they can not be sexually assaulted meme and shut ruth down . i with ruth would have told claire to shut the fuck up and reinforced that , what happened with nate is not ok , even if he pursued it and wasn t personally traumatised by it . it s a shame because i really love this show and these characters so far . what do you think ?"
1401,"a story from mediation , and my conclusion around christmas , things with my mother and my sister arrived at a point where i said , okay this has to change or i just do not want to see any of them any more . so i went to mediation with my mother i do not think my sis will ever go along , and it s a shame . lots of things were said , i think we found some agreement in places , i am cautiously hopeful . there was this one episode , when i related how hard it was to grow into my role as a man , because i felt like i was implicitly bad and evil , the potential rapist you know the drill . the way they talked about my father who left the family when i was , and the fact that my sister was getting into , umm young adult feminism let us say , surely did not help . and my mother laughed at me . right there , in front of a counselor . made a stupid joke about it . my initial reaction was utter disbelief mixed with anger more disbelief actually , it was just so absurd . later on , i found that this illustrates perfectly an issue we will have to resolve . we have at least one more session , and i will bring this up . incidentally , i have forgotten how the counsellor reacted . she did say something , and i think it was good , but i was deep in my own head there for a while . here s my conclusion whenever you find yourself trivializing a person s pain another person s or even your own then that points to an issue you might want to look into . we all know a gazillion methods of trivialization those usually levelled at guys you are just a sissy , grow some balls , but women have it far worse and of course all the stuff aimed at women she practically begged for it , are you on your period ? etc . not to mention racist junk , anti lgbtq junk , antisemitist junk , etc . etc . add your own personal favourites . it does not really matter what topic you choose to hide from a person s suffering . what matters is that you learn to look through your own strategies , and get rid of them ."
